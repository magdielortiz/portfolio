        <p class="description">For over twenty years Chashama has brought together artists and property owners to provide space where artists can live, work and present.
          The new identity centers around a distinctive logotype appealing to both landowners and artists that emphasizes key letters to make the name more familiar and easy to pronounce. The identity also incorporates a graphic outline that
          suggests the floorplan of a building, with a door open at the right to form the letter "C."
